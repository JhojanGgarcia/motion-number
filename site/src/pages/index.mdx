import Pre from '../components/Pre.astro';
export const components = {pre: Pre}
import Demo from '../components/Demo'
import DemoTransition from './_DemoTransition'
import DemoIndicator from './_DemoIndicator'

```jsx
// Basic usage
import MotionNumber from 'motion-number'

<MotionNumber
    value={value}
    format={{ notation: 'compact' }} // Intl.NumberFormat() options
    locales="en-US" // Intl.NumberFormat() locales
/>
```

See [MDN's `Intl.NumberFormat()` reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#parameters) for a full list of `locales` and `format` options.

## Customizing

MotionNumber is a [Motion component](https://www.framer.com/motion/component/), so it accepts a `transition` prop to customize
the transitions:

<DemoTransition client:load defaultValue="code">
```jsx
import { easeOut } from 'framer-motion'

<MotionNumber
    transition={{
        // Applied to layout animations on individual characters:
        layout: { type: 'spring', duration: 0.7, bounce: 0 },
        // Used for the digit animations:
        y: { type: 'spring', duration: 0.7, bounce: 0.25 },

        // Opacity applies to entering/exiting characters.
        // Note the use of the times array, explained below:
        opacity: { duration: 0.7, ease: easeOut, times: [0, 0.3] } // 0.3s perceptual duration
    }}
/>
```
</DemoTransition>

One important note: **if you override `opacity`, make sure to give it the same duration as the layout animation**.
This improves animation performance by ensuring Framer Motion doesn't remove exiting children
until the layout animation ends. If you want the opacity transitions to look shorter than the layout animations,
you can use the [`times` array](https://www.framer.com/motion/animation/##keyframes) with the format `[0, perceptualDuration]`,
as shown above. Also, make sure to use an [easing function](https://www.framer.com/motion/easing-functions/) rather than strings like `'linear'` or `'easeIn'`,
as they seem to work better. If you're using [`<MotionConfig>`](https://www.framer.com/motion/motion-config/) to set a `transition`, make sure to check the
opacity settings there as well.

Beyond the transitions, there's some CSS properties you can use to customize the display:

### `--mask-height`/`--mask-width`

These adjust the height and width of the gradient fade-out masks at the edges of the number.
`--mask-height` also gets used as the vertical padding for the number.

### `line-height`

In my opinion, the transitions look better with small vertical gaps between numbers, because it reduces the distance
the digits travel.
I recommend using the smallest `line-height` that fits all your component's characters:

```jsx
<MotionNumber style={{ lineHeight: 0.8 }} /* ... */>
```

The exact value will depend on your font and formatting options. MotionNumber uses a safe default `line-height` of 1, 
set through an inline style for simplicity. This means to override it globally you'll have to use `!important` (sorry about that; React 19 should clean this up):

```css
[data-motion-number] {
    line-height: 0.8 !important;
}
```

## Grouping

MotionNumber has four render props that can be used to synchronize other content with the number transitions:

* `before` adds elements before MotionNumber
* `first` prepends elements to MotionNumber
* `last` appends elements to MotionNumber
* `after` adds elements after MotionNumber

These can be combined to create interesting effects:

<DemoIndicator client:load>
```jsx
<MotionNumber
    value={value}
    format={{ style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' }}
    after={() => (
        <MotionNumber
            value={diff}
            format={{ style: 'percent', maximumFractionDigits: 2 }}
            animate={{ backgroundColor: diff > 0 ? '#34d399' : '#ef4444' }}
            style={{ borderRadius: 999 }}
            first={() => (
                <Arrow />
            )}
        />
    )}
/>
```
</DemoIndicator>

These are also helpful because [LayoutGroup](https://www.framer.com/motion/layout-group/) doesn't currently
work with MotionNumber; see the note in [limitations](#limitations).

## LazyMotion

If you're using [`<LazyMotion>`](https://www.framer.com/motion/lazy-motion/), you can import the lazy version of
MotionNumber with:

```js
import MotionNumber from 'motion-number/lazy'
```

The API is the same.

## Limitations

* [Scientific](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#scientific) and [engineering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#engineering) notations aren't currently supported
* Selected text inside the number will not respect color changes from `::selection`, if any
* `<LayoutGroup>` doesn't currently work with MotionNumber and causes noticeable jitters in the number animations.
This is likely due to MotionNumber's unusual two-step rendering process, where new digits are added before the layout animations occur.
